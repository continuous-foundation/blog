  title: CSF's Looks toward 2026
  description: |
    Continuous Science Foundation (CSF) was born in 2025 and started with something rare: momentum. Not the fragile kind that fades after a conference ends, but the sustained energy that comes from people actually building together. In Banff, we named the movement—Composable Science [@banff-2025]. In San Diego, we built the infrastructure and coalitions to make it real [@san-diego-2025]. Now, as we move into 2026, the question isn't whether modular scientific publishing will happen. It's how quickly we can move it from prototype to practice.
