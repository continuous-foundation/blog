title: CSF's Looks toward 2026

> The shift from tools to adoption isn't about building more—it's about connecting what already exists.

Continuous Science Foundation (CSF) was born in 2025 and started with something rare: momentum. Not the fragile kind that fades after a conference ends, but the sustained energy that comes from people actually building together. In Banff, we named the movement—Composable Science [@banff-2025]. In San Diego, we built the infrastructure and coalitions to make it real [@san-diego-2025]. Now, as we move into 2026, the question isn't whether modular scientific publishing will happen. It's how quickly we can move it from prototype to practice.

## The Infrastructure is Ready, The Ecosystem is Not

We have authoring tools that create structured content. We have repositories ready to share it. We have standards emerging that could connect them. What we don't have—what we're building—is the connective tissue that turns individual tools into an ecosystem.

This is what we call "the missing middle": the exchange formats, attribution frameworks, and governance structures that let innovation compound rather than compete. It's the difference between twenty great tools working in isolation and twenty great tools amplifying each other's impact.

## Three Working Groups, One Goal

In 2026, CSF is organizing our work around three strategic priorities that emerged directly from the Banff workshop. Each addresses a different barrier to adoption, and all three are interconnected:

### 1. Modular Peer Review

Peer review is still tethered to the article. But if science is modular—if we're sharing datasets, code, methods, and figures as first-class objects—then review needs to be modular too.

This working group is exploring what it means to review and certify components, not just complete papers. How do we recognize the value of a well-documented dataset before it's wrapped in a narrative? How do we create review processes that match the pace of computational research? How do we build trust in reused components?

We're not starting from scratch. [PREreview](https://prereview.org/), [octopus](https://octopus.ac), [eLife](https://elifesciences.org), and others have been experimenting with this for years. Our role is to help these approaches converge around shared principles and connect with the emerging technical standards.

### 2. Modular Reuse and Attribution

The current incentive structure is broken. Researchers are rewarded for publishing papers, not for creating reusable components. They're credited for first authorship, not for maintaining crucial infrastructure. They're evaluated on citation counts that don't capture computational contributions.

CSF is working with Creative Commons to support frameworks that make attribution and licensing work at the _component_ level. But technical standards alone won't shift incentives. This group is engaging with funders, institutions, and evaluation frameworks to make reuse count as both input and output.

The goal: make it easier to give credit than to extract it.

### 3. Technical Standards and Adoption

The Open Exchange Architecture ([OXA](https://oxa.dev)) that emerged from San Diego isn't theoretical—it's code, schemas, and working implementations. But for standards to matter, they need to be adopted. And adoption requires more than good technical design.

This working group is engaging directly with Quarto, MyST, Stencila, openRxiv, Curvenote, and others to pilot OXA in real publishing, technical-authoring, and curation workflows. And we're creating the documentation, examples, and support that tool builders need to implement these standards.

We're not asking publishers to replace their infrastructure. We're giving them an interoperability layer that works with what they have to create new futures for consuming modular research.

## From Soil to Flowers

In San Diego, we used a metaphor that stuck: [Bedrock, Soil, and Flowers](https://articles.continuousfoundation.org/articles/from-tools-to-adoption/day-1#the-bedrock-soil-flowers-metaphor). Bedrock is the foundational raw scientific materials: datasets, code, preprints, lab notes, and other primary research artifacts. It is the substrate upon which all higher layers depend. Flowers are the visible applications—new ways to discover, read, review, and interact with research.

The missing piece is soil: the organic, connective layer that turns bedrock into an ecosystem where flowers can grow.

That's what 2026 is about. We're building soil.

## Implementation over Inspiration

The Banff workshop gave us a movement. San Diego gave us architecture. Now we need adoption. That means:

- Piloting OXA with real content from preprint servers or journals
- Coordinating implementation across authoring tools so researchers don't have to choose between platforms
- Demonstrating what modular publishing enables through prototypes and new applications
- Engaging with communities of practice to understand what adoption actually requires

We're not waiting for consensus. We're building, learning, and adapting based on what works. What would change if, together, adoption became the signal of progress, not alignment or coordination?

## The Network Effect Starts Here

What excites us most about 2026 isn't any single project. It's watching the network effects kick in. When OXA gets adopted by just a few key platforms, suddenly every tool that implements it can interoperate. When modular peer review gets piloted in one community, others can fork and adapt it. When reuse is the goal, incentives shift everywhere.

This is how infrastructure becomes invisible. Not because it's hidden, but because it becomes so fundamental that people stop thinking about it.

## Getting Involved

The energy from San Diego hasn't dissipated—it's channeled into working groups that meet regularly, coordinate through shared repositories, and build in public. If you're working on tools, standards, or community practices that connect to this vision, we want you involved.

We're also actively seeking partners and funders who understand that the next phase of scientific communication won't be built by any single organization. It requires coordination, patience, and a willingness to build infrastructure that benefits everyone.

The bottleneck isn't ideas. It's not even technology. It's coordination, governance, and sustained effort. That's what CSF exists to steward.

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of 2026, we want researchers to be able to:

- Publish a computational notebook and have it automatically recognized by their institution as a valid research output
- Reuse a figure from someone else's work with proper attribution flowing through automatically
- Discover relevant datasets through the similar kinds of curation and recommendation tools they use for music and movies
- Participate in peer review that happens at the level of components, not just complete articles
- See their contributions to shared methods, data, and software valued alongside traditional papers

This isn't science fiction. Every piece of this is possible today. What we're building in 2026 is the connective infrastructure that makes it normal.
